SCOPer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SCOPer (Spectral Clustering for clOne Partitioning) provides a computational framework for the identification of B cell 
clonal relationships from Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing 
(AIRR-Seq) data. It includes methods for assigning clonal identifiers using
sequence identity, hierarchical clustering, and spectral clustering.
SCOPer is part of the [Immcantation](http://immcantation.readthedocs.io) 
analysis framework.
