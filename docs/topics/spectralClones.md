**spectralClones** - *Spectral clustering method for clonal partitioning*

Description
--------------------

`spectralClones` provides an unsupervised spectral clustering 
approach to infer clonal relationships in high-throughput Adaptive Immune Receptor 
Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) data. This approach clusters B or T cell receptor 
sequences based on junction region sequence similarity and shared mutations within 
partitions that share the same V gene, J gene, and junction length, allowing for 
ambiguous V or J gene annotations.

```

Arguments
-------------------

db
:   data.frame containing sequence data.

method
:   one of the `"novj"` or `"vj"`. See Details for description.

germline
:   character name of the column containing the germline or reference sequence.

sequence
:   character name of the column containing input sequences.

junction
:   character name of the column containing junction sequences.
Also used to determine sequence length for grouping.

v_call
:   name of the column containing the V-segment allele calls.

j_call
:   name of the column containing the J-segment allele calls.

clone
:   output column name containing the clonal cluster identifiers.

fields
:   character vector of additional columns to use for grouping. 
Sequences with disjoint values in the specified fields will be classified 
as separate clones.

cell_id
:   name of the column containing cell identifiers or barcodes. 
If specified, grouping will be performed in single-cell mode
with the behavior governed by the `locus` and 
`only_heavy` arguments. If set to `NULL` then the 
bulk sequencing data is assumed.

locus
:   name of the column containing locus information. 
Only applicable to single-cell data.
Ignored if `cell_id=NULL`.

only_heavy
:   This is deprecated. Only heavy chains will be used in clustering.
Use only the IGH (BCR) or TRB/TRD (TCR) sequences 
for grouping. Only applicable to single-cell data.
Ignored if `cell_id=NULL`.

split_light
:   This is deprecated. If you desire to split clones by light chains 
use dowser::resolveLightChains.

targeting_model
:   [TargetingModel](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/shazam/topics/TargetingModel-class) object. Only applicable if 
`method="vj"`. See Details for description.

len_limit
:   [IMGT_V](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/shazam/topics/IMGT_SCHEMES) object defining the regions and boundaries of the Ig 
sequences. If NULL, mutations are counted for entire sequence. Only 
applicable if `method` = `"vj"`.

first
:   specifies how to handle multiple V(D)J assignments for initial grouping. 
If `TRUE` only the first call of the gene assignments is used. 
If `FALSE` the union of ambiguous gene assignments is used to 
group all sequences with any overlapping gene calls.

cdr3
:   if `TRUE` removes 3 nucleotides from both ends of `"junction"` 
prior to clustering (converts IMGT junction to CDR3 region). 
If `TRUE` this will also remove records with a junction length 
less than 7 nucleotides.

mod3
:   if `TRUE` removes records with a `junction` length that is not divisible by 
3 in nucleotide space.

max_n
:   the maximum number of degenerate characters to permit in the junction sequence before excluding the 
record from clonal assignment. Default is set to be zero. Set it as `"NULL"` 
for no action.

threshold
:   the supervising cut-off to enforce an upper-limit distance for clonal grouping.
A numeric value between (0,1).

base_sim
:   required similarity cut-off for sequences in equal distances from each other.

iter_max
:   the maximum number of iterations allowed for kmean clustering step.

nstart
:   the number of random sets chosen for kmean clustering initialization.

nproc
:   number of cores to distribute the function over.

verbose
:   if `TRUE` prints out a summary of each step cloning process.
if `FALSE` (default) process cloning silently.

log
:   output path and filename to save the `verbose` log. 
The input file directory is used if path is not specified.
The default is `NULL` for no action.

summarize_clones
:   if `TRUE` performs a series of analysis to assess the clonal landscape
and returns a [ScoperClones](ScoperClones-class.md) object. If `FALSE` (default) then
a modified input `db` is returned with clone identifiers in the specified `clone` column. When grouping by `fields`, `summarize_clones` should be `FALSE`.

seq_id
:   The column containing sequence ids




Value
-------------------

If `summarize_clones=FALSE` (default) a modified input `db` is returned with clone identifiers in the specified `clone` column.
If `summarize_clones=TRUE` a [ScoperClones](ScoperClones-class.md) object is returned that includes the clonal assignment summary information and a modified input `db` in the `db` slot that contains clonal identifiers in the specified `clone` column.


Details
-------------------

If `method="novj"`, then clonal relationships are inferred using an adaptive 
threshold that indicates the level of similarity among junction sequences in a local neighborhood. 

If `method="vj"`, then clonal relationships are inferred not only on 
junction region homology, but also taking into account the mutation profiles in the V 
and J segments. Mutation counts are determined by comparing the input sequences (in the 
column specified by `sequence`) to the effective germline sequence (IUPAC representation 
of sequences in the column specified by `germline`). 

While not mandatory, the influence of SHM hot-/cold-spot biases in the clonal inference 
process will be noted if a SHM targeting model is provided through the `targeting_model` 
argument. See [TargetingModel](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/shazam/topics/TargetingModel-class) for more technical details.

If the `threshold` argument is specified, then an upper limit for clonal grouping will 
be imposed to prevent sequences with dissimilarity above the threshold from grouping together. 
Any sequence with a distance greater than the `threshold` value from the other sequences, 
will be assigned to a singleton group.


Single-cell data
-------------------


To invoke single-cell mode the `cell_id` argument must be specified and the `locus` 
column must be correct. Otherwise, clustering will be performed with bulk sequencing assumptions, 
using all input sequences regardless of the values in the `locus` column.

Values in the `locus` column must be one of `c("IGH", "IGI", "IGK", "IGL")` for BCR 
or `c("TRA", "TRB", "TRD", "TRG")` for TCR sequences. Otherwise, the operation will exit and 
return an error message.

Under single-cell mode with paired-chain sequences, there is a choice of whether 
grouping should be done by (a) using IGH (BCR) or TRB/TRD (TCR) sequences only or
(b) using IGH plus IGK/IGL (BCR) or TRB/TRD plus TRA/TRG (TCR) sequences. 
This is governed by the `only_heavy` argument. There is also choice as to whether 
inferred clones should be split by the light/short chain (IGK, IGL, TRA, TRG) following 
heavy/long chain clustering, which is governed by the `split_light` argument.

In single-cell mode, clonal clustering will not be performed on data were cells are 
assigned multiple heavy/long chain sequences (IGH, TRB, TRD). If observed, the operation 
will exit and return an error message. Cells that lack a heavy/long chain sequence (i.e., cells with 
light/short chains only) will be assigned a `clone_id` of `NA`.



Examples
-------------------

```R
# Subset example data
db <- subset(ExampleDb, c_call == "IGHG")

# Find clonal groups
results <- spectralClones(db, method="novj", germline="germline_alignment_d_mask", summarize_clones=TRUE)

```

*Running defineClonesScoper in bulk mode and only keep heavy chains*
```R

# Retrieve modified input data with clonal clustering identifiers
df <- as.data.frame(results)

# Plot clonal summaries
plot(results, binwidth=0.02)

```
