# The SCOPer package

Description
--------------------

`scoper` is a member of the Immcantation framework and provides computational approaches 
for the identification of B cell clones from adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing 
(AIRR-Seq) datasets. It includes methods for assigning clonal identifiers using
sequence identity, hierarchical clustering, and spectral clustering.






Clonal clustering
-------------------




+ [identicalClones](identicalClones.md):  Clonal assignment using sequence identity partitioning.
+ [hierarchicalClones](hierarchicalClones.md):  Hierarchical clustering approach to clonal assignment.
+ [spectralClones](spectralClones.md):  Spectral clustering approach to clonal assignment.



Visualization
-------------------



+ [plotCloneSummary](plotCloneSummary.md):  Visualize inter- and intra-clone distances.
